# 📘 Student Management System (Java)
A simple Java console application that demonstrates inheritance, interfaces, method overloading/overriding, and polymorphism, based on the assignment requirements.

## 📌 Features
### ✔ Add Student
Enter roll number, name, email, course, and marks.

### ✔ Update Student
Edits an existing student record.

### ✔ Search Student
Displays details of a single student.

### ✔ View All Students
Shows all stored student records.

### ✔ Grade Calculation
Grades are assigned automatically based on marks:

◦A → 90+
◦B → 75–89
◦C → 60–74
◦D → <60

## 🧰 Concepts Used
◦Abstract Class (Person)
◦Inheritance (Student extends Person)
◦Interface (RecordActions)
◦Polymorphism (Dynamic Method Dispatch)
◦Method Overloading and Overriding
◦HashMap for efficient student storage
